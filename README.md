# That is not dead which can eternal lie

Project to write an academic monography, without actually knowing, if this will ever be fruitful and happening. So, as it can certainly lie eternally (well, as long as this repo exists), it is probably not dead. Motivating, isn't it?

## Workflow

Revolutionary OpenScience'ish: I write stuff, I push it, I do a release and you can all look at me and shame me for all the mistakes and stupid thoughts. And in the end (if this will every happen), it can simply be transformed to proper formats, since it's markdown. Nice and easy.

## DOI

I got one from the eternal dumpster: [![DOI:10.5281/zenodo.8251979](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8251980.svg)](https://zenodo.org/record/8251980)
