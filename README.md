# That is not dead which can eternal lie

This is a radical OpenScience'ish project. I am most certainly not an enthusiast when it comes to academic writing, especially not a monography. However, the next goal would be a "Second Monography", so here we go. Maybe this way it is a little more fun and I can also use it as proof that doing stuff radically open doesn't break anything (or so I hope). However, since I don't know if that will be successful, I think a good working title is this Lovecraft quote. As long as this thesis does lie here eternally, it is not dead. :o)
